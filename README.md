# SoCal RUG - Nonparametric Analysis: A Primer

**Sharpen your Data Science skills with this is a hands-on workshop on Nonparametric techniques in R.**

## About this Event

The classical statistical analysis is performed under the assumption that the underlying distribution of a variable of interest is known, or the sample size is sufficiently large (at least 30) so that the Central Limit Theorem starts working. This type of analysis is termed Parametric Statistics because all that needs to be done is to find estimates of distribution parameters and draw the inference based on these estimates. If, however, nothing is known about the underlying distribution and the sample size is small (less than 30), there will be no parameters to be estimated and a completely different methodology has to be applied to do statistical inference. The collection of methods in this case is called Nonparametric Statistics.

In this presentation, we will go over several most widely used nonparametric techniques. For each technique, just enough theory will be explained, followed by a thorough example or two, and then the audience will work on an exercise to reinforce understanding of the material.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyzing data and interpreting results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions, and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).

## Biography of Dr. Olga Korosteleva

Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). She received her Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 1996 from Wayne State University in Detroit, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 2002. Since then she has been teaching mostly Statistics courses in the Master’s program in Applied Statistics at CSULB, and loving it!

Dr. Olga is an undergraduate advisor for students majoring in Mathematics with an option in Statistics. She is also the faculty supervisor for the Statistics Student Association. She is also the immediate past-president of the Southern California Chapter of the American Statistical Association (SCASA).

## Set-up Instructions

You have two options for working with the code examples and exercises for the workshop:

### On your own computer
1. Download and install R and RStudio (if you haven't already)
2. Download the examples and exercises code from the workshop GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ocrug/regression_models_2021-02-09](https://github.com/ocrug/regression_models_2021-02-09)
	1. If you don't know how to use Git, download the course files by clicking the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
	2. If you do know how to use Git, clone the repo to your computer
3. Unzip the files (or go to the directory where you cloned the repository), and double click the file called `project.Rproj`.  This will start RStudio and you can see the examples and exercises code in the two folder called examples and exercises.
4. Install the following packages
    * `bootstrap`
    * `devtools`
    * `exactRankTests`
    * `fANCOVA`
    * `magrittr`
    * `rstudioapi`
    * `stats`
    * `stringr`
    * `tibble`
    * `tidyverse`

### Using RStudio Cloud
1. Create a free account on RStudio Cloud: [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
2. Go to the workshop project: [https://rstudio.cloud/project/3583424](https://rstudio.cloud/project/3583424)
3. At the top of the project window, Click "Save a Permanent Copy" — it's by the flashing red "Temporary Project" sign.
4. The project and all its files will now be in your own Personal workspace.  You have 25 free hours per month using RStudio Cloud.
## GitHub Repo

You will be able to access all the slides, code, and other course material in the course repository. You can [download](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the content as a ZIP file. If you use this method you will not be able to get updates that will be made unless you download the content again. Another alternative is to clone the git repo. To do this you will need to install git. You can find instructions on doing that [here](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/setup/install_git.txt).

**Please install git and clone the following repo before the event and pull before the start of the event**
