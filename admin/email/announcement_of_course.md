Hello SoCal RUG

SoCal RUG is excited to announce that the Nonparametric stats course is back on. The Covid restrictions that cause us to postpone the January course have been lifted!

The course will take place on Saturday 2022-02-26. It will be a full day, in-person (if COVID restrictions allow for it) statistics course. Sign-up and level-up your data science skills. It will be taught by Dr. Olga Korosteleva from CSU Long Beach.

This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundation knowledge to effectively use some of the most common nonparametric models used by data scientists. The classical statistical analysis is performed under the assumption that the underlying distribution of a variable of interest is known, or the sample size is sufficiently large (at least 30) so that the Central Limit Theorem starts working. This type of analysis is termed Parametric Statistics because all that needs to be done is to find estimates of distribution parameters and draw the inference based on these estimates. If, however, nothing is known about the underlying distribution and the sample size is small (less than 30), there will be no parameters to be estimated and a completely different methodology has to be applied to do statistical inference. The collection of methods, in this case, is called Nonparametric Statistics.

In this presentation, we will go over several most widely used nonparametric techniques. For each technique, just enough theory will be explained, followed by a thorough example or two, and then the audience will work on an exercise to reinforce understanding of the material.

The course will give examples in R and you will be taught how to create these models and interpret the output. You will work in small groups to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material.

For more information or to sign-up, check out the Eventbrite site. There is a small fee for this course. We want it to be open to all. Therefore, we have set aside a limited number of free tickets. Please reach out to me if you would like to apply for one of these tickets.

Cheers
