Hello:

You are getting this message because you have signed up for the Nonparametric Analysis: A Primer course.

The course is being hosted at the University of California, Irvine and they have decided that they will not be having in-person events in the month of January due to COVID restrictions. Therefore, we have moved the course to Saturday, Feb. 26th 2022. Your ticket for the Jan. 22 event will be valid for the Feb 26 event. If you are not able to attend the event on the new date, you will be able to get a refund up to a week before the event.

We apologize for this inconvenience.

Cheers
John Peach
