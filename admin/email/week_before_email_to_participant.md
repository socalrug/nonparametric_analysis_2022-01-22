# Important message about Saturday's stats course

Hello:

You are getting this message because you have signed up for the SoCal RUG Nonparametric Analysis: A Primer course. You will need to bring your computer to the event and you will need to setup your machine before the course.

## Setup

To make the most of your time, there are a number of things that you should do to prepare for the event.

1. Carefully read the [README](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/README.md) file for the event.
1. SoCal RUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. Please read and abide by the [SoCal RUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
1. We will be using [slack.com](https://slack.com/) during the event. 
    1. If you are not on the [SoCal RUG Slack channel](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack) please [sign-up](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack-signup).
    1. Join the **nonparametric-2022** channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the course.
1. Information for the event is kept in the [course repo](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22) GitHub repo. You will need to install *git* / *GitBash*. You can get instructions [here](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/setup/install_git.txt).
```
git clone https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22.git
```
1. Run the [check_setup.r](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/check_setup.r) script. It will make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software. **This can take quite a while to run**.

If you are having problems getting the check_setup-r script running or do not have R installed on your computer, you can use RStudio Cloud. This will give you access to RStudio in a browser. We have set up a projected with all the code and libraries installed.
1. Create a free account on RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud
1. Go to the workshop project: https://rstudio.cloud/project/3583424
1. At the top of the project window, Click "Save a Permanent Copy" â€” it's by the flashing red "Temporary Project" sign.
1. The project and all its files will now be in your own Personal workspace. You have 25 free hours per month using RStudio Cloud.


## Other Details

1. The event will be held at the Paul Merage School of Business at UC Irvine in building SB1, room 2100. See the [parking instructions](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) and how to locate SB1.
