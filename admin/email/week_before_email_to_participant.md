# SoCal RUG Nonparametric Analysis: A Primer

## Setup

To make the most of your time, there are a number of things that you should do to prepare for the event.

1. Carefully read the [README](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/README.md) file for the event.
1. SoCal RUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. Please read and abide by the [SoCal RUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
1. We will be using [slack.com](https://slack.com/) during the event. 
    1. If you are not on the [SoCal RUG Slack channel](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack) please [sign-up](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack-signup).
    1. Join the **nonparametric-2022** channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the course.
1. Information for the event is kept in the [course repo](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22) GitHub repo. You will need to install *git* / *GitBash*. You can get instructions [here](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/setup/install_git.txt).
```
git clone https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22.git
```
1. Run the [check_setup.r](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/README.md) script. It will make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software. **This can take quite a while to run**.

## Other Details

1. The event will be held at the Paul Merage School of Business at UC Irvine in building SB1. See the [parking instructions](https://github.com/socalrug/nonparametric_analysis_2022-01-22/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) and how to locate SB2.
1. Registration will be between 8:30 and 9:00. The event will start at 9:00.
